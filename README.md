# From Waste to Resource: Design Optimization and Augmented Fabrication for Reusing Concrete Elements

Welcome to the repository for the **From Waste to Resource** workshop. This workshop explores innovative techniques for reusing concrete waste in construction, utilizing computational design and augmented fabrication workflows. Here, you’ll find all necessary files, scripts, and resources for following along with the digital and physical prototyping processes introduced during the workshop.

## Repository Structure

- **/Grasshopper_Files**  
  Contains all Grasshopper files (.gh) used for computational design workflows, including:
  - Scanning and processing concrete waste geometries.
  - Computational packing, clustering, and design strategies.
  - Optimized design configurations for reuse in architectural elements.

- **/OBJ_Files**  
  Includes object (.obj) files of scanned waste pieces for use in design configurations and assembly planning. These files can be imported into Rhino or Unity for further exploration and development.

- **/Python_Files**  
  This folder contains Python scripts used in the workflow.

## Prerequisites

To work with the files in this repository, please ensure the following software and plugins are installed:

- **Rhinoceros 7 or 8** – for 3D modeling and integration with Grasshopper.
- **Grasshopper Plugins**:
  - **Polyhedra** – used for geometric operations.
  - **OpenNest** – for arranging and nesting elements within the design.

For the AR-guided assembly portion, **Unity** (preferably version 6.0+), is recommended. Unity will be used to simulate and visualize the assembly sequence in augmented reality.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**
